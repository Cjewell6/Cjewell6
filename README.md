## About

Iâ€™m a mathematics and computer science professor at Albion College. My scholarship focuses on the applications of mathematics and computer science to art and I frequently give talks at professional conferences and write about related topics. I am also an artist. I use a wide variety of media and incorporate mathematical elements such as symmetry, geometry, and number in my art. My work is frequently included in juried art exhibitions. You can see and read about my artwork on my website [drMathArt.com](http://drmathart.com).
